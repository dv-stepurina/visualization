# Data Analysis & Visualization Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of data analysis and visualization projects completed as part of an intensive training program. The projects demonstrate proficiency in:

- **Python** (Pandas, SQLite integration)
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- **Statistical Analysis**
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for reproducible research

## Key Projects

### 1. Behavioral Pattern Analysis
- Analyzed user activity patterns (commits, pageviews) across time dimensions
- Created visualizations showing:
  - Daily/weekly activity trends
  - Hourly commit distributions
  - Differences between workdays vs weekends
- Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 2. Newsfeed Impact Study
- Conducted A/B test analysis comparing control vs test groups
- Visualized distributions using boxplots
- Calculated IQR and identified outliers
- Tools: Statistical visualization, hypothesis testing

### 3. Interactive Visualizations
- Built animated time-series charts showing commit leaderboards
- Created interactive heatmaps of user activity patterns
- Tools: Plotly, advanced Seaborn

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Processing**: SQL queries, Pandas transformations, datetime handling
- **Visualization Types**:
  - Line charts with custom styling
  - Multi-axis comparative plots
  - Histograms and boxplots
  - Scatterplot matrices
  - Animated visualizations
- **Analysis Techniques**:
  - Time-series decomposition
  - Correlation analysis
  - Outlier detection
  - Cohort analysis

## Repository Structure

## How to Use
1. Clone repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run Jupyter notebooks: `jupyter notebook`
4. View pre-rendered visualizations in `/images/`

## Key Insights
- Identified peak activity hours (15:00-21:00 on weekdays)
- Discovered significant differences in weekend vs weekday patterns
- Visualized non-linear relationships between metrics
- Created production-ready interactive dashboards

This work demonstrates strong competencies in data analysis and visualization for behavioral analytics applications.
